# Advanced Java: Data Structures and Complex Patterns

A repository dedicated to advanced Java concepts, focusing on:
- Data Structures (e.g., Trees, Graphs, Linked Lists)
- Algorithms (e.g., Sorting, Searching)
- Complex Patterns (e.g., Floyd's Triangle, Pascal's Triangle)

## Features
- Implementation of popular data structures:
  - Binary Trees, AVL Trees
  - Graph algorithms like DFS, BFS
  - Stack, Queue, Linked List
- Complex patterns and number series:
  - Floyd's Triangle
  - Pascal's Triangle
  - Star and numeric patterns
- Fully documented code with explanations and examples.
